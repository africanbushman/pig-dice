## Specs
# Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a 'die' until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to hold.
* If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
* If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
